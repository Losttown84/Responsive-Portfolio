      <p>Born and raised in New York, mainly Long Island and Queens. Moved to Chicago at 22 without knowing anyone and went to Columbia College, DNF. Bounced around several jobs until landing at my current employer. Looking to venture out into something new and hence here I am learning to code.</br> I live in Andersonville with my fiance where we have two dogs, a beagle named Maggie and a mutt named Cahill. They are 12 years old and 5 years old respectively. </br>I'm a NY sports fan, unfortunately, so go Mets, Giants and Islanders.
